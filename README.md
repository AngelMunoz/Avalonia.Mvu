# NXUI + F#

This is a simple template to get started with [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) and [F#](https://fsharp.org/) through [NXUI](https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/NXUI).

```
dotnet run --project src/App
```

You should briefly see your application window showing on your desktop.

# Alternatives

Although NXUI is a great way to get started with Avalonia and F#, there are other options available:

- Plain [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/)
- [Avalonia.FuncUI](https://github.com/fsprojects/Avalonia.FuncUI)
- [Fabulous.Avalonia](https://github.com/fabulous-dev/Fabulous.Avalonia)

All of them offer similar or different approaches to building UIs with F#.
